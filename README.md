# COVID-19 in developed and developing nations: Analysis

Video summary: https://youtu.be/CWdrA1iiGsM

In this project we wanted to answer one broad question:

Why is it that less developed nations have not felt the effects on COVID-19 to the same extent developed nations have?

In order to answer this question, we downloaded a data set by the Our World In Data Foundation (https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus) and performed analysis on the obtained data after cleaning and restructuring it.

This analysis was made in collaboration with Malte DÃ¼hrsen and Philip Muehlenfeld.
